 `C = 5 * ((F-32) / 9)`.

10. Make a program that asks for the temperature in degrees Celsius, transforms it and shows it in degrees Fahrenheit.

11. Write a program that asks for 2 integers and a real number. Calculate and show:
- the product of twice the first and half of the second.
- the sum of three times the first and the third.
- the third raised to the cube.

12. Having as input data the height (h) of a person, build an algorithm that calculates his ideal weight, using the following formulas:

- For men: (72.7*h) - 58
- For women: (62.1*h) - 44.7

13. Make a Program that asks how much you earn per hour and the number of hours worked in the month. Calculate and show your total salary in that month, knowing that 11% is deducted for Income Tax, 8% for INSS and 5% for the union, make a program that gives us:

- gross salary.
- how much did he pay to the INSS.
- How much did you pay the union?
- the net salary.
    
calculate the deductions and the net salary, according to the table below:

    + Gross Salary: BRL
    - IR (11%): BRL
    - INSS (8%): ​​BRL
    - Union (5%): BRL
    = Net Salary: BRL

14. Make a Program for a paint store. The program should ask for the size in square meters of the area to be painted. Consider that the coverage of the paint is 1 liter for every 6 square meters and that the paint is sold in 18 liter cans, which cost R$80.00, or in 3.6 liter cans, which cost R$25.00 .

Inform the user of the quantities of ink to be purchased and the respective prices in 3 situations:
- buy only 18 liter cans;
- buy only 3.6 liter gallons;
- mix cans and gallons, so that less paint is wasted. Add 10% slack and always round up, consider full cans.
